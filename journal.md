# Misc notes & thoughts.

## Day 11

I was worried part two would be one of those runs-for-12-hours-and-then-runs-out-of-memory kinds of twists, where I had to totally re-think my approach and spot the math trick. But it turned out to be another simple extension of part one.

One thing I've learned, comparing my current approach to past years, is to treat these 2-dimensional grids a single list of objects. I used to try wrangling them as 2-dimensional arrays in js, but it's so much easier to work with javascript's list functions on a single list.

## Day 10

Last bit of catching up to current.

Got lucky with part two. My leftover array from part one happened to be exactly what I needed for autocompletion.

---
## Day 8

Playing catch-up after 2 sick days, I decided up front that I would settle for ugly-but-working.

That turned out to be a good choice. I worked it out segment by segment with giant if statements, and got it on the first shot.

## Day 7

I was worried part 2 might turn out to be too slow for brute force.

Wound up being good enough.

If that hadn't worked, I probably would've tried started searching outward from the average position next.

## Setup

Copied repo from last year, removed all the input & solution files (kept only 01.1), and removed unused modules.
