## Day 10

Last bit of catching up to current.

Got lucky with part two. My leftover array from part one happened to be exactly what I needed for autocompletion.

---
## Day 8

Playing catch-up after 2 sick days, I decided up front that I would settle for ugly-but-working.

That turned out to be a good choice. I worked it out segment by segment with giant if statements, and got it on the first shot.

## Day 7

I was worried part 2 might turn out to be too slow for brute force.

Wound up being good enough.

If that hadn't worked, I probably would've tried started searching outward from the average position next.

## Setup

Copied repo from last year, removed all the input & solution files (kept only 01.1), and removed unused modules.
