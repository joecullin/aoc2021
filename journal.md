# Misc notes & thoughts.

I'm sticking with nodejs this year, and still feeling like I'm learning little new things. It's such a different type of coding (recursion!) than my day-to-day.

I'm in a private leaderboard with some https://www.barracuda.com/ colleagues.

## Day 11

I was worried part two would be one of those runs-for-12-hours-and-then-runs-out-of-memory kinds of twists, where I had to totally re-think my approach and spot the math trick. But it turned out to be another simple extension of part one.

One thing I've learned, comparing my current approach to past years, is to treat these 2-dimensional grids a single list of objects. I used to try wrangling them as 2-dimensional arrays in js, but it's so much easier to work with javascript's list functions on a single list.

## Day 10

Last bit of catching up to current.

Got lucky with part two. My leftover array from part one happened to be exactly what I needed for autocompletion.

---
## Day 8

Playing catch-up after 2 sick days, I decided up front that I would settle for ugly-but-working.

That turned out to be a good choice. I worked it out segment by segment with giant if statements, and got it on the first shot.

## Day 7

I was worried part 2 might turn out to be too slow for brute force.

Wound up being good enough.

If that hadn't worked, I probably would've tried started searching outward from the average position next.

## Setup

Copied repo from last year, removed all the input & solution files (kept only 01.1), and removed unused modules.

## Previous years

* https://github.com/joecullin/aoc2018 - barely competent in nodejs, used this to learn more. Struggled with promises & async flow, gave up after day 9.
* https://github.com/joecullin/aoc2019 - comfortable in node but still learning. Stopped after day 16 due to other demands on my time.
* https://github.com/joecullin/aoc2020 - Got all 50 stars! Some of the later puzzles were tough though.
* https://github.com/joecullin/aoc2021 - You're looking at it. See my thoughts above.
